## Project Description

The focus of the project is to tell a story with the help of visualizations of the data from UNICEF and WHO which advocates for accelerated improvements in children’s well-being, singles out challenges and roadblocks on the way to a higher health quality, and answers the question of whether we are doing enough in the fight for children’s rights, needs and 
adequate support. 

To acheive the goal several means of presenting the visualized data are used:
- Dashboard
- Presentation
- Blog post
- Infographic
- Video presentation


## Development
- Visualizations -  Tableau
- Integrated programming language in Tableau - Python
- OS - Windows 10 Home
